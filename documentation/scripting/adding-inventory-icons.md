# Adding Inventory Icons

Adding icons for the inventory must be done in a `.png` format as it's the most accessible. It's recommended that you use at least `64x64` or a `128x128` image. Anything larger will pretty much be pointless since the inventory doesn't scale much larger.

Icons need to be placed inside of:

```
src/core/client/views/inventory/icons
```

It is highly recommended that you compress your `.png` file after it has been resized.
