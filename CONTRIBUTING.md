## What will Athena Accept?

* Bug Fixes
* New Features within the idea of a Framework

## What will Athena Not Accept?

* Very specific features such as... an LSPD Faction, a death box system, etc.

Athena is targetted towards developers who need core functionality.

If you wish to create those things they should be individual plugins for the framework.
