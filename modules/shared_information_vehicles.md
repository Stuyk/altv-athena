## Variables

### VehicleData

• `Const` **VehicleData**: [`VehicleInfo`](../interfaces/shared_interfaces_vehicleInfo_VehicleInfo.md)[]

If you add a 'modded vehicle' you will need to append it into this list.
This list contains the seat count, and basically makes modded vehicles function.

Make sure you look at other example vehicles because `seat count` may not be what it seems.
Find a default vehicle that has similar seating to the vehicle you are adding.
