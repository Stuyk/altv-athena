Benny's Custom Menu by Selene-Desna ( It's okay to remove credit but please say it's mine if asked )

    Hello There, this script was originally made for a french server so translation may be not that good, tried my best.
    Colors names and HexCodes are from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ikZaC0_B7BUPDpZYzBZ5oj57Ba1uh54E8gQ0yCzG0g/pubhtml


    Translations and colors names are in /menu/app.js

    Contain :

    Global Menu
        Choose Between the 6 other Menus, come back to this one by clicking on the X button
        ( The 4th one is a faster link to the Sticker Livery that is in Paint Bomb Menu )
