## Setup

Go to your `resources` folder and paste the folder you downloaded. I prefer to clone this repository using git.

```
git clone https://github.com/NicholasSchmitz/altV-smartphone.git
```

Edit your `server.cfg` file and paste the name of this resource to the resources array. Like this:

```
resources: [
    ...
    ...
    altV-smartphone
]
```
